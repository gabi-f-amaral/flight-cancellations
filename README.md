# Flight Cancellation Prediction in Australia

## Project Overview
This project predicts the probability of flight cancellations on Australian domestic routes using historical flight data from 2010 to 2025.

The objective is to allow users to ask:
> "What is the probability that my flight will be cancelled on a given route and month in 2026?"

## Data
- Source: Australian domestic flight statistics
- Granularity: Route × Month (all airlines)
- Period: January 2010 – August 2025
- Pandemic period (2020–2023) excluded from modeling

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and aggregation
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering (lags, seasonality)
- Binary classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Model evaluation using F1-score and PR-AUC
- Forecasting cancellation risk for 2026
